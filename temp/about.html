										<p>My name is Wali Ashraf Riad, and I am going to show you how to start blogging. I have been building blogs and websites since 2002. In that time I have launched several of my own blogs, and helped hundreds of others do the same.</p>
										<p>I know that starting a blog can seem overwhelming and intimidating. <strong>This free guide is all about blogging for beginners</strong>, and will teach you how to be a blogger with just the most basic computer skills. So whether you’re 8 or 88, you can create your own blog in less than 20 minutes.</p>
										<p>I am not ashamed to admit that when I was first learning how to build a blog I made a ton of mistakes. You can benefit from more than a decade of my experience so that you don’t repeat these same mistakes when you make your own blog. I created this free guide so that anyone can learn how to blog quickly and easily</p>

										<h3>What is a blog anyway?</h3>
										<p>In short, <strong>a blog is a type of website that focuses mainly on written content</strong>, also known as blog posts. In popular culture we most often hear about news blogs or celebrity blog sites, but as you&#8217;ll see in this guide, you can start a successful blog on just about any topic imaginable.</p>
										<p>Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a &#8220;comments&#8221; section where readers can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your readers in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.</p>
										<p>This direct connection to the reader is one of the main benefits of starting a blog. This connection allows you to interact and share ideas with other like-minded people. It also allows you to build trust with your readers. Having the trust and loyalty of your readers also opens up the door to making money from your blog, which is something I discuss later in this guide.</p>
										<h3>Should you start a blog?</h3>

										<p>

											<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1423" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20289%20256'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="Simple steps to help you create a blog easily" width="289" height="256" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/start-your-first-blog.png"><noscript><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1423" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/start-your-first-blog.png" alt="Simple steps to help you create a blog easily" width="289" height="256"></noscript><br />

										One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.</p>
										<p>In addition, you don&#8217;t need to be an expert on your topic in order to have a successful blog. For example, readers of a cooking blog don&#8217;t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.</p>
										<p><strong>To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.</strong></p>
										<p>At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Choosing a topic that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. Writing about more than one topic is totally fine too. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your readers interested.</p>
										<p>So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:</p>

										<ul>
											<li><strong>Make money from home.</strong> Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a blog post and then continue to make money from it long after the blog post is written. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.</li>
											<li><strong>Share your story.</strong> A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.</li>
											<li><strong>Recognition for yourself or your business.</strong> No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest blog post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.</li>
											<li><strong>Find a community.</strong> Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a blog post and people comment on it. This is a great way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.</li>
										</ul>

										<p>The good news is that the internet is exploding with growth right now. More people than ever are online. This explosion in growth means more potential readers for your blog. In short, if you are thinking about starting a blog then there is no better time than right now.</p>
										<p>So, just how do you start a blog?<a name="bloggingsteps"></a></p>




										<h2>How to Start a Blog in 6 Steps</h2>
										<p>Learn how to create a blog in about 20 minutes following these steps:</p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Pick a blog name.</strong> Choose something descriptive.</li>
											<li><strong>Get your blog online.</strong> Register your blog and get hosting.</li>
											<li><strong>Customize your blog.</strong> Choose a free template and tweak it.</li>
											<li><strong>Write &amp; publish your first post.</strong> The fun part!</li>
											<li><strong>Promote your blog.</strong> Get more people to read your blog.</li>
											<li><strong>Make money blogging.</strong> Choose from several options to monetize your blog.</li>
										</ol>
										<p><strong>Let&#8217;s start your blog!</strong></p>




										<h2 id="blogs">Step 1: Pick a blog name</h2>
										<p>The first step to finding a good blog name is choosing your topic.</p>
										<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what to blog about, there are <u>a few ways to find a good blog topic</u>:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Hobbies &amp; passions.</strong> Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about more obscure hobbies can be successful, since the your audience is literally anyone in the world with the internet.</li>
											<li><strong>Life experiences.</strong> Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations. For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman&#8217;s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).</li>
											<li><strong>A personal blog.</strong> A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share you thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Once you have a topic it&#8217;s time to choose your blog name.</p>
										<p><strong>A good blog name should be descriptive</strong> so that potential readers can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.</p>




										<h2>Step 2: Get your blog online</h2>
										<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a name picked out it&#8217;s time to get your blog online. This might sound hard or technical, but the steps below will walk you right through and <em>make the process easy</em>.</p>
										<p>To get your blog up and running you need two things: blog hosting and blogging software. The good news is that these typically come packaged together.</p>
										<p>A blog host is a company that stores all of the files for your blog and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog name. <strong>You must have a blog host in order to have a blog</strong>.</p>
										<p>You also need to have the software to build your blog. In this guide I will be showing you how to build a blog using the WordPress blogging software, because it is the most popular, customizable, and easiest to use.</p>
										<p><a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/bluesthost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1168" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20250%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="post-it" width="250" height="200" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post-it1.gif"><noscript><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1168" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post-it1.gif" alt="post-it" width="250" height="200"></noscript></a>The blog host I recommend, and the one I show you how to use in this guide, is <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/bluesthost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueHost</a>. I personally use BlueHost and I recommend them for all new bloggers because:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>They will register your blog name for you for free, making sure no one else can take it.</li>
											<li>They offer a free, simple installation of the WordPress blogging software (which I show you how to use in this guide).</li>
											<li>They have been recommended by WordPress since 2005 and currently host over 2 million blogs and websites.</li>
											<li>They have helpful 24/7 customer service via phone or web chat.</li>
											<li>They have a 30 day money-back guarantee if you are unsatisfied for any reason.</li>
										</ul>




										<h2>Step 3: Customize your blog</h2>
										<h3>Logging in</h3>
										<p>If you are not already logged-in from the previous step, go to <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/bluesthost" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluehost.com</a> and click &#8220;Login&#8221; on the top right to bring up the login screen.&nbsp; You can then login using your domain name and the password you set in the previous step.&nbsp; If you have misplaced your password you can reset it by clicking the &#8220;Forgot Password&#8221; link.</p>
										<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3605" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20418'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="600" height="418" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login-300x209.jpg 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3605" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="418" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/bluehost-login-300x209.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></p>
										<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Once you log-in you will be taken to your BlueHost Portal.&nbsp; From the portal you can click the blue &#8220;WordPress&#8221; button to be logged-in automatically to your blog.<br />
										</span></p>
										<h3>Changing your blog design</h3>
										<p>Once you login you will be in the WordPress administrator area. This is where you can make any changes you want to your blog.</p>
										<p>Everyone has a different idea of how they want their blog to look. One of the great things about a WordPress blog is that you can change your entire layout and design with just a few clicks.</p>
										<p>In WordPress, blog layouts are known as “Themes”. What is a blog theme? Themes control the entire design of your blog. To change your theme you are going to click on the “Appearance” tab on the left menu.</p>
										<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20281'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="600" height="281" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1-300x141.png 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2298" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="281" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1.png 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-theme-install-1-300x141.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></p>
										<p>You will see several themes are already installed on your blog: Twenty Seventeen, Twenty Sixteen, etc. These are well-designed, clean-looking themes that can work for just about any type of blog. In fact, many of the world&#8217;s top bloggers use one of these themes.</p>
										<p>Unless you have a very specific design in mind for your blog, <strong>I suggest you use one of these themes to start with</strong>. For our example, let&#8217;s use the &#8220;Twenty Sixteen&#8221; theme. In order to activate the theme on your blog, hover over the theme and click the &#8220;Activate&#8221; button. That&#8217;s it! You have changed the entire design of your blog with just one click!</p>

														<p>Congratulations! You now know how to start your own blog and publish content!</p>
														<p>For more info on blog content guidelines, click the tabs below:</p>
														<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4656c52"  tabindex="0" title="Content That Should be on Your Blog"    >Content That Should be on Your Blog</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4656c52" class="collapseomatic_content content">
														There are two main types of content your blog should provide: static and dynamic content.</p>
														<p><strong><u>Static Content:</u></strong> Each blog should contain a few necessary pages explicitly designed to provide the visitor with the tools they need. The content on these pages is static, meaning &#8211; the content doesn’t change, or at least not very often. These are mainly top-level pages that can be accessed via a menu on your blog.</p>
														<p>These static content pages should be in place well before you launch your blog to the world.</p>
														<p>Important static pages to include:</p>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>About Me (Us)</strong> &#8211; This page should include a biographical summary of the author(s) as well as a mission statement. Think about the answers to these questions: <em>How did your passion for the subject matter develop?</em> <em>What do you want to convey to the world?</em> <em>What is your ultimate goal?</em></li>
															<li><strong>Contact Me (Us)</strong> &#8211; A contact page provides the visitor a place to reach the author which, in turn, provides the visitor with the reassurance that you are a real and reachable author. You can add your physical address, phone number, and email. Or you can utilize a simple contact form to keep your personal identifying information private. You should put links to all of your social media accounts here as well.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>Aside from your blog, which is generally introduced on the home/main page, these two all-important pages should be visible on your top (header) menu and easy to access.&nbsp; You can take a look at the top of this page to see how I have these pages included in the header menu.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/step-4-configure-your-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See this detailed guide to customizing your blog menus</a> if you need help.</p>
														<p>Other static pages that are equally as important but less commonly thought of are:</p>
														<ul>
															<li><strong>Disclaimer Page</strong>: If you intend to make money from your blog, you must describe the ways you intend to generate income. This is an absolute must-have page that should not be overlooked, as per FTC guidelines. For example, if you are discussing and endorsing a product, and stand to monetize from affiliate links to this product, this relationship must be disclosed.</li>
															<li><strong>Privacy Policy</strong>: If you collect data from your visitors in any way, you are required to add a privacy policy page that tells visitors exactly how you are collecting data, how you are using it, and if you are sharing that data. If you implement Google Adsense or Google Analytics on your blog, a Privacy Policy must be used. This page is required by the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).</li>
															<li><strong>Terms of Service</strong>: If your blog is also running a store or selling services, it is best to have a lawyer draft your Terms of Service page to lessen liability and provide maximum protection.</li>
														</ul>
														<p>These required static pages are typically found in the footer of a blog. They should, at the very least, be visible and accessible from the home page.&nbsp; Again, look at the bottom of this page to see how this looks in practice.</p>
														<p>There are other static pages you can choose to include depending on what suits your blog and business. Common static page examples are an advertising page to solicit paid advertisements, a donations page, a resource page to direct visitors to your favorite links within your field, and a page for submitting ideas and content.</p>
														<p><strong><u>Dynamic Content:</u></strong> Your dynamic content is your blog and the most important content you have to offer. This is where you, as the creator, will infuse the blog with your brand of informative blog posts that supply your audience with knowledgeable tips, facts, opinions, and stories. This is how you engage your visitors and keep them coming back for more.</p>
														<p>Your blog posts should be regularly submitted at specific intervals. Waiting months to create a post will never build a following. Posting weekly and driving traffic to these posts will help build your brand.<br />
														</div>
														<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4656d5b"  tabindex="0" title="How to write a great blog post"    >How to write a great blog post</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4656d5b" class="collapseomatic_content content">
														Each blog post should be lengthy, informative, and engaging. It’s not always easy to come up with different topics on a regular basis and you are free to mix up the tone and even the subject matter to keep things lively and interesting. It’s your space, after all. But there are a few elements that each and every blog post should endeavor to include.</p>
														<p><strong>Define the Blog Post:</strong> Create an alluring post title that stimulates curiosity and encourages clicks. Use the first paragraph of your post to clearly define the topic of your article and provide a possible hook to keep the reader reading.</p>
														<p><strong>The Longer the Better &#8211; But Break It Up</strong>: The more information and detail you include, the better. But readers will begin to skim if the content contains lengthy paragraphs a mile long, and readers will pop out faster than they came in. Readers enjoy tidbits. Keep your paragraphs short with spaces in between, use lists and standout quotes, use images, and always include headers and subheaders so that readers can find what they’re looking for.</p>
														<p><strong>Engage The Reader:</strong> At the end of each blog post, a common tactic used to engage readers is posing a meaningful question to your audience and asking them to reply in the comments. This simple measure can increase engagement tenfold.</p>
														<p><strong>Original Content:</strong> Your blog posts should always be original. Never plagiarize &#8211; you will eventually be called out on it and could even face consequences. Your content should come from your heart, your brain, your knowledge base, and your experience. You can get topic ideas from others in your field, but make sure the content comes from you.</p>
														<p><strong>Original Photos:</strong> While it is easy to include stock images from free image sites, it is even better to include your own photos and graphic work. Another idea is to take free images and manipulate them with a free photo editor.</p>
														<p><strong>Edit Your Work: </strong>Make sure your blog posts are sufficiently edited. Nothing says unprofessional like several typographical and grammatical errors. If you need a few refresher courses in grammar, consider using a writing application.<br />

														<h2>Step 5: Promote your blog</h2>
														<p>Creating a well-designed blog and writing great content is just the start. In order to get readers for your blog you will need spend some time promoting it, especially when you first start. Click on the strategies below for more info.

															The very first people who should become aware of your blog are your inner circle. This includes family, friends, and colleagues within your field. Encourage them to become followers, ask them to mention your new blog, and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; thank them.<br />
														</div>
														<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4656e16"  tabindex="0" title="Use Social Media"    >Use Social Media</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4656e16" class="collapseomatic_content content">

															<p>While you don’t want to overdo it with social media accounts, you still want to create accounts with the “biggies”. Create a Facebook page, Twitter account, Pinterest account, and Instagram account to start.&nbsp; You should post each new blog post on your social media accounts, but you can also post relevant news and links to other sources that your readers may find interesting.&nbsp; Don’t forget to use hashtags and engage with your followers!</p>
															<p>One of my favorite ways to get readers to my blog is to post links on my social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter. This is great, because not only do your friends see the link, but if your friends share the link with their friends it automatically multiplies your readers. If you have created high-quality content on your blog then social media is a great way for your blog to go viral.<br />

																Find other blogs in your community and engage with them. Using the comment section, introduce yourself and leave engaging and constructive comments. Many will allow you to leave a link to your blog. After creating relationships with prominent bloggers in your community, you will find yourself within their ranks quickly.<br />
															</div>
															<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4656ecd"  tabindex="0" title="Engage with Your Readers"    >Engage with Your Readers</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4656ecd" class="collapseomatic_content content">
																When your readers leave comments on social media posts or on your blog, always engage with them. Reply to their comments and questions, give them “likes” and affirmations. When it is obvious that the author cares about his/her community and readership, visitors are naturally encouraged to return.<br />

															<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4656f06"  tabindex="0" title="Collaborate"    >Collaborate</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4656f06" class="collapseomatic_content content">
															Become enmeshed in your blogging community by collaborating with respected members of your field. Collaborating includes guest posting, promoting each other’s blogs and products, and regularly interacting through comments and social media.</p>
															<h3>Post Regularly</h3>
															<p>Post content regularly. Create an editorial calendar and stick to it. A good blogger posts at least once per. If you have long lapses between posts, your followers will drop off and your growth will be severely hampered. It’s not easy to post on a schedule, but it&#8217;s something you absolutely must stick to.<br />

																<p>In addition to getting new readers to your blog, you will also want to make sure your current readers are coming back. This is where email marketing plays a big role. By collecting the email addresses of your visitors (with their permission of course), you can then notify them when you post something new on your blog. This keeps people coming back to your blog, which not only gives you more readers over time, it also allows you to build a closer relationship with your visitors.</p>

																You want search engines to include your blog in their search results as soon as possible.</p>
																<p><strong>Google: </strong>Sign up for a Google Webmaster account and open the Search Console. To add your blog, click “Add Property” and follow the steps to add your blog.</p>

																<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4656fc0"  tabindex="0" title="SEO"    >SEO</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4656fc0" class="collapseomatic_content content">
																SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of optimizing your blog to receive traffic from search engines like Google.&nbsp; Submitting your blog to search engines is the first step.&nbsp; However, keep in mind that with a brand new blog your search engine results are going to be minimal to start with. However, this will change over time as long as you continue to add informative and relevant content on a regular basis. The more you add, and the more time that goes by, the better your search engine results will become. And search engine results lead to traffic and a larger audience.</p>
																<p>With regards to SEO, each blog post should include these fundamental elements:</p>
																<ol>
																	<li><strong> Header Tags: </strong>Section headings and subheadings should be wrapped in header tags.&nbsp; To do this, click on the left item of the block you are writing in and change it to &#8220;Heading&#8221;.&nbsp; You can then choose from H1, H2, H3, etc.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3990" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="600" height="142" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/headings.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/headings-300x71.jpg 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/headings.jpg" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3990" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/headings.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="142" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/headings.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/headings-300x71.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></li>
																	<li><strong> Categorization:</strong> Search engines depend on hierarchy. Your posts should be clearly categorized into specific and relevant categories.&nbsp; In the post editor screen, click on &#8220;Document&#8221; on the right menu, and then go down to &#8220;Categories&#8221; and &#8220;Add New Category&#8221;.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3991" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20401'%3E%3C/svg%3E" alt="" width="600" height="401" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/add-post-category.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/add-post-category-300x201.jpg 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-lazy-src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/add-post-category.jpg" /><noscript><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3991" src="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/add-post-category.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/add-post-category.jpg 600w, https://www.theblogstarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/add-post-category-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></noscript></li>
																	<li><strong> Permalinks:</strong> Each blog post “slug” is the end portion of the URL. You want to make sure each blog post has a defined slug and doesn’t end with an article number. You can easily change this in your WordPress dashboard by going to “Settings” -&gt; “Permalinks”. Select the “Post Name” option and click “Save Changes”</li>
																</ol>
																<p>There are many more factors relating to SEO, but these are the big ones that will help your blog appear in search engines sooner rather than later.<br />

																<h2>Step 6: Make money blogging</h2>
																<p>Once you have put in the effort of creating great blog content and promoting your blog, making money from your blog is actually the easy part.</p>
																<p>Blogs have the potential to be extremely lucrative, but don’t assume that you’re going to start making money in the first week, or even in the first month. It could take six months to a year to start seeing a steady stream of income. Blogging takes work and dedication, but once you develop a large enough audience, there are several methods you can employ to monetize your blog. For more information see my <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/how-to-make-money-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full guide to making money blogging here</a>. Click on the tabs below for details on a few methods you can use.</p>
																<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f465700f"  tabindex="0" title="Sell Advertising Space"    >Sell Advertising Space</h3><div id="target-id5f541f465700f" class="collapseomatic_content content">
																Once you have a popular blog, advertisers will be hounding you for the opportunity to advertise. The best way to take advantage of this situation is to use Google Adsense. Google finds the advertisers for you and all you have to do is place the Google Adsense code on your blog to start running ads. Google Adsense takes all of the hard work out of the process and just cuts you a check.</p>
																<p>I go into the full details of <a href="https://www.theblogstarter.com/how-to-install-adsense-on-your-wordpress-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to set up Google Adsense for your blog here</a>.<br />
																</div>
																<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f4657061"  tabindex="0" title="Affiliate Programs"    >Affiliate Programs</h3><div id="target-id5f541f4657061" class="collapseomatic_content content">
																An affiliate program is a commission-based way to advertise. When one of your readers clicks on a link on your blog, they get sent to an advertiser&#8217;s site and you earn a commission if they purchase. Affiliate links are a great way to earn income through the use of product reviews. However, you must remember to disclose your affiliation.</p>
																<h3>Selling Products and Services</h3>
																<p>Selling your own products and services directly on your blog is a great way to increase your income. As your blog grows and you begin to see a wide audience, your products and services will begin to sell themselves.</p>
																<p>Use the sidebar of your blog to increase the visibility of what you sell using visual images and a link to your storefront page.</p>
																<h3>Digital Downloads</h3>
																<p>Ebooks, video tutorials, and e-courses are the most commonly consumed digital materials sold by bloggers. With little to no overhead and no shipping costs, you can keep the price low and inviting.</p>
																<p>If you are extremely knowledgeable in your field, an ebook can practically write itself. Give it a try, you might surprise yourself!<br />
																</div>
																<h3 class="collapseomatic " id="id5f541f46570a5"  tabindex="0" title="Memberships"    >Memberships</h3><div id="target-id5f541f46570a5" class="collapseomatic_content content">
																Another way to monetize is by creating membership options on your blog. This allows you to offer members more exclusive content only available with a paid membership. For example, you could offer unlimited downloads of digital goods, free consultations, a private network or forum where community members can mix and mingle, and private content available to members only.</p>
																<p>There are many ways a blog can capitalize on popularity and traffic. Choosing the way you monetize from your blog depends on your goals and the purpose of your blog. Those who are selling services, physical goods, and digital goods, for example, may not want to participate in affiliate programs where traffic could be lost to another site.</p>
																<p>Take the time to explore the many ways you can make money from blogging. It will take time before you ever see your first penny. But with dedication, love, and attention, the income will spring forth.<br />
